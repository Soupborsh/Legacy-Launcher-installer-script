# Legacy-Launcher-installer-script
Script to install legacy laucher.

I do not recommend using it seriosly. I is my first somewhat complex script. I created it for me and friends.

To run it execute folowing:

bash -c "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Soupborsh/Legacy-Launcher-installer-script/main/launch.sh )"
